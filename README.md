## Overview

This project implements a Huffman coding trees compression in C++. This tool is designed to handle `.txt` and `.bin` files. The tool demonstrates:

- Ensuring lossess data compression to preserve essential information
- Canonical Huffman coding for deterministic encoding
- Optional visualization of Huffman trees (ASCII & Graphviz)
- Modular CLI interface analogous to a Linux command interface
- Working on images and PDF files.

---

## Features

- Compress text or binary files using Huffman coding
- Decompress previously compressed files
- Generate ASCII and Graphviz `.dot` visualizations of Huffman trees
- Custom priority queue implementation to illustrate heap mechanics
- Cross-platform command-line interface
